An online retailer provides express shipping for many of its items at a rate of $10.95 for the first item, and $2.95
for each subsequent item. Write a function that takes the number of items in the order as its only parameter. Return
the shipping charge for the order as the function’s result. Include a main program that reads the number of items
purchased from the user and displays the shipping charge.
